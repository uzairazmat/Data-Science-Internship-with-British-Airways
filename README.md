# Data-Science-Internship-with-British-Airways
This repo includes two data science projects from my internship with British Airways. Project 1 involves scraping and analyzing customer reviews using NLP. Project 2 focuses on building a machine learning model to predict bookings. Both projects end with business insights in PowerPoint slides.
